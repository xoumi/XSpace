title: Creating Remark-directive plugins
---

While I was working on the global typography of this site, I came across [this gist](https://gist.github.com/seyoum/72b4aafbacc10df28e2d22c7fd2d07e6). It had a variety of realistic markup with actual sentences instead of just lorem ipsum. One of the sentences read as follows:

> Short items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.

To differentiate a 'short list' from a normal one we need to bring in css classes to our document which would mean bringing in html's syntax as well. I felt that beats the simplicity of using markdown.  
Enter [remark-directive](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive). It lets us to create our own custom blocks of text in markdown and manipulate them as per our requirements.

Taking the above problem, I can use `remark-directive` to denote a inline block. Let's call it 'shortlist'. Next, I can write another custom remark plugin that adds the 'shortlist' class to any `ul` or `ol`. I think the below _feels_ like markdown would have:

```markdown
:: shortlist
  * small
  * words
  * list
```

::file[customName.js]{.fileName}
```js
for (var i = 0; i<=10; i++) {
    // say hello
    echo("hello");
}
```

compared to using the inbuilt html override.

```markdown
<div class="shortlist">
  * small
  * words
  * list
</div>
```
